# serial_parity_detector
In this code, I designed a parity generator that calculates parity based on an input bit x. It uses an EVEN/ODD state machine to toggle the parity state on each clock cycle, producing the appropriate parity bit z. The logic ensures that the output aligns with the current parity state and handles unexpected states by resetting to EVEN.
